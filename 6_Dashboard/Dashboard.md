## Dashboard Insights

The dashboard shows that air transport dominates the shipment distribution, indicating a strong reliance on faster but potentially higher-cost logistics. However, the average delivery days are highest for Air Charter, suggesting inefficiencies in that mode despite its premium nature.

The on-time delivery rate of 88.51% indicates generally strong performance, but there is still a gap to reach optimal service levels.

From the country comparison, a small number of countries contribute the majority of shipment value, highlighting key strategic markets that drive logistics performance.

The monthly trend shows fluctuations in shipment value with a peak around September, which may reflect seasonal demand patterns.

Overall, the dashboard helps identify high-value regions, delivery bottlenecks, and transport mode efficiency, supporting data-driven logistics decision-making.
