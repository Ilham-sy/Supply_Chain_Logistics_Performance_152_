📊 Supply Chain Logistics Performance Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

In this project, I acted as a Business Intelligence Analyst and built an end-to-end Supply Chain Logistics Performance Dashboard in Power BI to solve a real-world logistics analysis scenario.

My objective was to analyse:

Delivery performance

Shipment value trends

Country-level distribution

Shipment mode efficiency

to support data-driven logistics decision-making.

This project follows a complete BI workflow:

Dataset Selection → Data Preparation → Data Modelling → Dashboard Development → Deployment

📂 Dataset

I used a real-world supply chain shipment dataset containing:

Scheduled delivery dates

Actual delivery dates

Shipment modes (Air, Air Charter, Truck, Ocean)

Countries

Vendors

Product groups

Quantity and shipment value

The dataset contains more than 7,000 rows, which allowed me to build a proper analytical data model.

🔄 Part A — Data Preparation (Power Query)

I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation in Power Query.

Key transformations I applied:

Renamed queries for clarity

Removed unnecessary columns

Removed duplicate records

Fixed incorrect data types

Handled missing/null values

Trimmed and standardized text

Split project codes into meaningful attributes

Created a Revenue Check (Total Value) derived column

Extracted Year, Month, and Quarter from date fields

Built separate dimension tables:

Dim_Date

Dim_Country

Dim_Product

Dim_ShipmentMode

Dim_Vendor

Each major table contains more than 10 applied steps, which is shown in the Power Query screenshots and the Query Dependency view.

🧱 Part B — Data Modelling

I designed a star schema to support scalable analytics.

Fact table

Fact_Delivery

Dimension tables

Dim_Date

Dim_Country

Dim_Product

Dim_ShipmentMode

Dim_Vendor

Modelling decisions

Configured one-to-many relationships

Applied single-direction filtering

Avoided many-to-many relationships

Hid technical key fields from report view

Organised the model logically in Model View

This structure improves performance and ensures clean filtering across visuals.

🧮 DAX Calculations

I created the following key measures:
```

Total Deliveries = COUNTROWS(Fact_Delivery)

Total Shipment Value = SUM(Fact_Delivery[Total Value Check])

Total Quantity = SUM(Fact_Delivery[Quantity])

Delivery Days =
DATEDIFF(
    Fact_Delivery[Delivered to Client Date],
    Fact_Delivery[Scheduled Delivery Date],
    DAY
)

Avg Delivery Days = AVERAGE(Fact_Delivery[Delivery Days])

On Time Delivery Rate =
DIVIDE(
    SUM(Fact_Delivery[On Time Delivery]),
    COUNTROWS(Fact_Delivery),
    0
)
```

These measures allow me to monitor volume, value, efficiency, and service performance.

📊 Part C — Dashboard Development

I designed a single-page executive dashboard with a logical top-down layout.

🔝 KPI Summary

Total Deliveries → 10K

On-Time Delivery Rate → 88.51%

Total Quantity → 189M

Total Shipment Value → 45M

These provide a quick operational overview.

📈 Trend Analysis

Shipment Value Trend by Month

This helps identify seasonal shipment patterns and performance changes over time.

🌍 Comparative Analysis

Shipment Value by Country

This highlights high-value countries and supports regional logistics strategy.

🚚 Distribution Analysis

Shipment Mode Distribution

This shows the proportion of shipments by transport mode.

⏱️ Performance Analysis

Average Delivery Days by Shipment Mode

This identifies which transport modes are fastest and which contribute to delivery delays.

🎛️ Interactivity

I added slicers for:

Year

Country

Product Group

Shipment Mode

All visuals are cross-filtered to enable dynamic exploration.

🎨 Design Approach

I used a minimal professional theme:

Teal → primary logistics metrics

Yellow → performance indicator (On-Time Delivery Rate)

Clean layout → KPI → Trend → Comparison → Distribution → Performance

This structure supports executive decision-making.

🚀 Part D — Deployment

I published the report to Power BI Service, generated a public dashboard link, and confirmed accessibility.

The repository includes screenshots of:

Dataset sourcing

Power Query transformations

Applied steps

Query dependencies

Data model relationships

Dashboard page

Publishing confirmation

📊 Key Insights

From the dashboard I observed:

On-time delivery performance is 88.51%, indicating room for improvement

Air transport dominates shipment volume

Some shipment modes have significantly higher delivery times

Shipment value is concentrated in a few top countries

Monthly shipment value shows mid-year peaks

These insights support route optimisation, mode selection, and regional planning.
